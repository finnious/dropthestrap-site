# Drop The Strap Marketing

> SEO and AI search optimization for businesses that need to show up — on Google, in AI answers, and everywhere customers are looking.

Drop The Strap Marketing is a Memphis-based search marketing company that plays both games: traditional SEO that drives billions of daily visits, plus AI search optimization (GEO) that gets businesses cited when ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Google AI Overviews answer customer questions.

## About

Drop The Strap Marketing rebuilt its entire approach because the search game changed. Most SEO companies still run the old playbook — keywords, backlinks, blog posts, and hoping Google notices. There is now a second game running: AI search engines are answering questions directly, and businesses that are not getting cited are invisible in that channel entirely. Drop The Strap plays both.

Named after Jerry "The King" Lawler's signature move — pulling down one strap of his singlet to signal the finisher was coming. When we show up, somebody's getting pinned.

Memphis-based. Two locations — Memphis and Collierville, Tennessee. Serving clients nationally.
