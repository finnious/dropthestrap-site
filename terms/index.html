<p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the website www.dropthestrap.com and the services provided by Drop The Strap Marketing, a project of Creating Value LLC ("we," "us," "our"). By using our website or purchasing our services, you agree to these Terms.</p>

<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Drop The Strap Marketing provides SEO and AI search optimization services including diagnostic reports and custom projects. Our entry-point products include The Knockout Report ($97), The AI Visibility Scorecard ($147), and The Double Down ($197). Custom projects are scoped and priced individually after a Paid Discovery Session.</p>

<h2>Report Products</h2>
<p>Reports are delivered as branded PDF documents within 3–5 business days of purchase. Reports contain analysis and recommendations based on publicly available information about your website and competitive landscape at the time of delivery. Reports are diagnostic in nature — they identify issues and recommend fixes. They do not include implementation, ongoing optimization, or guaranteed outcomes.</p>

<h2>No Guarantees</h2>
<p>We do not guarantee specific search engine rankings, traffic levels, AI citation placement, or revenue outcomes. Search engine algorithms and AI models change regularly and are outside our control. Our reports and services provide informed analysis and actionable recommendations, not guaranteed results.</p>

<h2>Custom Projects</h2>
<p>Custom projects require a Paid Discovery Session ($500) before any work begins. The discovery fee is credited toward the project if you proceed. Custom projects are scoped individually and governed by a separate project proposal and agreement. Maximum 3 client touchpoints per project phase. Scope changes constitute a new project with new pricing.</p>

<h2>Payment Terms</h2>
<p>All payments are processed through Stripe or invoiced through Creating Value LLC. Report products require payment before delivery. Custom projects are invoiced per the terms specified in the project proposal. All invoicing is through Creating Value LLC.</p>

<h2>Refund Policy</h2>
<p>Report products are non-refundable once delivered. If we are unable to deliver a report for any reason, a full refund will be issued. Custom project refund terms are specified in individual project agreements.</p>

<h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>All reports, deliverables, and materials we produce for you are owned by you upon full payment. Our internal methodologies, tools, frameworks, and processes remain our intellectual property.</p>

<h2>Confidentiality</h2>
<p>We treat all client information as confidential. We will not share your business information, website data, or project details with third parties without your consent, except as required by law or as necessary to deliver our services (e.g., using analytics tools to analyze your website).</p>

<h2>SMS Communications</h2>
